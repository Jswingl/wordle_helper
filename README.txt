Welcome to the WORDLE helper!

The Wordle helper is a simple assistant for the game of Wordle.
It won't tell you the correct answer so it does not constitute cheating.
It merely tells you what possible words are left to guess after each of your guesses.
Please note that these words are not always the optimal choices to provide more clues.
I suggest that once the helper has narrowed the list of words down to a number you can manage,
you analyze the words to find out what word (with what key letters) will allow you to distinguish between them all.

Simply run wordle_helper.py with Python, no packages needed!
While playing Wordle fill in what you know about the word according to the prompts from the helper.


Happy wordling!
